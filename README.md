# The Potential of Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts in the Energy Sector: A Review

The purpose of this paper is to review and assess the application of blockchain technology and smart contracts in the rapidly evolving energy market. To this end, we identify their characteristics, the challenges, and their potential under the prism of a detailed literature review. Also, we will attempt to identify and qualitatively evaluate the most recent, and mature research efforts in the field. More specifically, this work:

- Presents the characteristics and advantages of blockchain technology to justify its adoption trend in the energy sector. Furthermore, an analysis of the concept, the properties, and the use cases of smart contracts is performed. Consequently, their relation to the different forms of energy trade (P2P, P2G, EVs, EAAS, etc.) is thoroughly described. At the same time, the limitations and challenges that have been recently encountered by the scientific community are mentioned.

- Carries out a comprehensive and scientifically based literature review, including the progress made in recent years in the field. The scientific articles included are classified into three categories:
  - **Energy Market and Regulations (EMnR)**
  - **Energy Management and Operations (EMnO)**
  - **Business Models and Applications (BMnA)**

  In addition, the independent smart contract technology (SCT) class that focuses on the technological aspects of developing smart contracts is identified. Finally, after having listed the advantages, limitations, challenges, and risks of adopting blockchain technology in the energy sector, a SWOT analysis is carried out, to provide the reader with a comprehensive view of the fieldâ€™s potential in the near future.
